<h1>What's Blythe</h1>
<p>28.07.2014</p>
<p>Manufactured by Kenner in 1972, the original Blythe (now known as “vintage”) was produced for only one year and then was retired because of poor sales.<br/>

30 years later, in 1999, Junko Wong, President and CEO of CWC saw Blythe snapshots at the CWC New York office opening party. She fell in love with Blythe and knew she would be an instant sensation in Japan.<br/>

Then, in late 2000, she made her comeback in Japan when CWC produced a charming TV commercial for Parco department store starring Blythe. After the TV spotlight she became an overnight sensation in Japan and Asia.<br/>

Neo Blythe was reborn, no longer as a child’s toy but as a fashion doll appealing to adult doll collectors. Neo Blythe ushered in the era of contemporary doll culture and collecting. 
In June 2001, to meet the popular demand of this new Blythe fan base, CWC produced an 11 inch neo-Blythe doll, Parco Limited Edition, with the permission of Hasbro and the manufacturing help of Takara. This was the very first Neo Blythe doll. ＊The first designs for Neo Blythe were inspired by the Kenner Vintage Blythe designs. Later on Neo Blythe was produced with original concepts and designs by the CWC design team Junie Moon. <br/>

In 2002, Neo Blythe’s cute little sister, Petite Blythe was produced. She measured 11 cm and was a sweet addition to the Blythe family. In 2005, Blythe figurines were produced. In 2010, a new 20 cm medium sized Blythe doll was produced. Middie Blythe is the lovely adolescent sister to Neo and Petite. Until 2011 there are 185 types of Neo Blythe, 200 styles of Petite Blythe, and 5 Middie Blythe created in Japan. <br/>
